# Oliver-Dark Pattern Detection Chrome Extension

## Overview

The Dark Pattern Detection Chrome Extension is a tool designed to identify and highlight dark patterns on websites. Dark patterns are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended decisions. This extension aims to raise awareness about such practices and help users make informed choices while browsing.

## Features

- **SVM** The extension uses a SVM classifier to identify and categorize patterns as "Dark" or "Not Dark" based on pre-trained models.

- **Logistic regression** The extension uses a Logistic regression classifier to identify the category of the dark pattern detected

- **Severity Scoring:** Dark patterns are classified into different categories with severity scores, providing users with insights into the nature and potential impact of the observed patterns.

- **Privacy Policy Compliance Check (Future Enhancement):** The extension plans to incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess the compliance of websites' privacy policies with GDPR regulations.
